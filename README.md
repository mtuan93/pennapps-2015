Opo - Compare Transportation Options with Ease
</h2>

<p>
Opo is a multiplatform (iOS, Android, Web) app that helps people figure out which mode of transportation is the best option for them. Using public 
APIs from Uber, Google Maps, and SEPTA, Opo compares the time and cost associated with traveling from one place to another.
</p>

<p>
Today, Uber is taking the world by storm, but it was not long ago that the service of having a driver come and pick
you up at your location was too expensive to take advantage of. That memory still lingers in people's minds, and many people
don't realize that in many instances it's not much more expensive than public transportation, although it is considerably
more inconvenient. It's no secret that you get what you pay for, and when you pay for Uber you're going to have a better 
experience with your travel than taking public transportation.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, perhaps you're looking to travel and you just want whatever mode of travel will get you there the soonest, regardless
of comfort. With the information provided through Uber, Google Maps, and SEPTA, you can rest assure that you'll be provided with the information
you need to help you come to the decision that best fits what you're looking for.
</p>

<p>
Whether you're looking to save some money and choose the cheapest option, or you're curious whether or not you can spare a couple dollars for the 
convenience of Uber, Opo is an application to help users make educated decisions about how they travel.
